# My Personal Project

## Euchre

Ever since I was young I love to play cards with my family. We had a repertoire of card games that we would play
together and as I got older they would teach me more difficult games, Euchre being one of the most difficult to
learn but one where we got the most competitive. This is one of the ways I stayed connected to my grandparents and
extended family so making this a personal project of mine is something near and dear to my heart. As a new CS student
I am using this project as an opportunity to improve upon the skills I learnt in school and learn new development
techniques that I will require in this project and use in the future.

I recognize that there are many euchre apps already available for Apple and Android, but the ones I have looked at have
minimal options for house rules. My goal is to provide an accessible game for friends and family to play from a distance
and to practice.

## Goals for future versions

1. Multiplayer console application with no house rules
2. Add options for house rules
3. Use persistence package to save user data
4. GUI
5. Add event logging to track the plays and hands of a game
6. Online multiplayer
